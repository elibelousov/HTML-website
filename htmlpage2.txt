<h2 style="color:DodgerBlue;" >The better question should be "what can't be modded?":</h2>

<p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;font-family:arial" >
 Technically every aspect of the game that does not involve messing with the engine can be modded. These aspects however vary greatly in complexity. The start date of the game can be changed by simply opening up the defines file located in common, defines and then changing it from 1836 to the time of your choosing. Changing AI behaviour on the other hand is something that would require dealing with many different files and folders as well rigiorous testing and an intricate knowledge of ai behaviours to effectively change.</p>
